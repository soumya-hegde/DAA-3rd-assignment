OUTPUT OF PROGRAM WITH  SAMPLE DATA:
 1. Pass the sequence of integers in command line arguments as input variables which is separated by comma. 
    For example let us enter 
    8,7,3,5,1
 2. Run the program.
 3. The sample output would be as,
    sorted heap is:1 5 3 8 7
    minimum heap sort:8 7 5 3 1  
 
TOTAL NUMBER OF BASIC (KEY)OPERATION i.e COMPUTATION OF TIME COMPLEXITY:
  It takes O(logn) for heapify and O(n) for constructing a heap.Hence,the overall time complexity of heapsort using min heap is O(nlogn).
