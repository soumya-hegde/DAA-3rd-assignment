CONTRIBUTION:
1.Rekha NC -Heapify and report making.
2.R.Soumya -Heapsort and submission.
3.Sri Chandana P -Heapify and testing the code.

INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1.Pass the sequence of integers in command line arguments as input variables which is separated as comma.
2.Run the program.

CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW WE ADDRESS THESE:
1.Use of inputs with comma was a challenge.Then we googled and got to know about the vectors.
2.We wrote the swapping function in the beginning but we found that we have built in swap function in c++ and thus we used it.
3.Here we actually did not use much of the c++ headerfiles but found that it is a best practice of using bits/stdc++.h file so as to decrease the compilation time instead of mentioning a bunch of files separately for each particular task.

WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
1.Vector concept which we goggled and learnt the usage.
2.About the file bits/stdc++.h in c++.
